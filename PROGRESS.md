# Progress log

Repository-local session log. Read it at clock-in, update it at clock-out (AGENTS.md). The
session-start hook prints the `## Current Verified State` section and the clean-state check requires
this file to change on every branch; keep that heading text exactly.

## Current Verified State

- Repository root: `harness/`.
- Standard startup path: `./init.sh` (`FAST=1` skips the baseline).
- Standard verification path: L1 `pnpm check` (typecheck, Prettier, `harness check`, Vitest). Per
  feature: `pnpm harness:verify F-NNN`.
- The repository runs its own loop: features come from `harness-retro` issues filed by project
  retros (docs/self-improvement.md). Releases stay manual (docs/developing.md → Releasing).
- Last verified: F-001 on this commit, `pnpm check` green on 2026-10-24.
- Highest-priority unfinished feature: F-002 (session turns), then F-003 (in-flight notice).
- Current blocker: none.

## Next Steps

1. Build open `harness-retro` issues as they arrive (`pnpm harness:loop`, intake picks them up).

## Session Log

### Session 002 — 2026-10-24 (fixes from the first overnight loops)

- Goal: fix what the overnight loops of idea-generator, personal-finances and metsavahti showed
  (F-001…F-003, added by hand from the run logs; no retro issue was filed).
- F-001: generators ran `harness:evaluator` themselves before clock-out (about 15 of ~60 sessions)
  and idled on `ScheduleWakeup` for it. Clock-out step 7 only said "skip when `HARNESS_LOOP=1`" in a
  trailing parenthesis, and the generator prompt tells sessions to follow those steps. The guard now
  denies an `Agent`/`Task` call for the evaluator in loop mode (new `Agent|Task` PreToolUse matcher),
  step 7 leads with the condition and the generator prompt says to skip it. Interactive sessions can
  still run the evaluator. The projects pin v0.2.0, so each got the same rule in its
  `docs/harness/generator-notes.md` until a release reaches them.
- Verification: `pnpm harness:verify F-001` → L1 `pnpm check` pass.

### Session 001 — 2026-10-23 (self-hosting bootstrap)

- Goal: make this repository a harness project so its loop can build retro fixes.
- Completed: `harness.config.json`, `feature_list.json`, AGENTS.md, init.sh, `docs/harness/`;
  `harness:*` scripts; the doctor accepts the harness repository without a plugin pin; loop sessions
  here get the plugin of the driver's checkout, never the one they edit.
- Verification: `pnpm harness:verify F-000` → L1 `pnpm check` and `pnpm harness:doctor` pass; F-000 passing.
- Next best step: once released, enable `retro` in the projects and run this loop for the issues they file.
